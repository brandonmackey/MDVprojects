                        <h5>1. Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios? </h5> <br/>
                        
                        I think companies like Twitter have you use there service to log in to apps so you only need one password to log in but it also gives Twitter access to use there service more. It lets them post stuff from the apps you are using and makes you spend more time with there service. 
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                        <h5>2. Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically? </h5> <br/>
                        
                        JSON-P or JSON with padding,  it provides a method to request data from a server in a different domain, something prohibited by typical web browsers because of the same origin policy.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <h5>3. Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</h5> <br/>
                        
                        Programmableweb.com has more api's then I know what to do with but a geolocation api would be great for my What To Do? app if I am somewhere I could save a location of what to do later or like a bucket list to cross off something from that location. Also to take a picture would be nice to save with that geolocation.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <h5>4. Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month. </h5> <br/> 
                        
                        I want to be able to take a picture and save it in the app for my What To Do? app.  I would also like to save a geolocation for that app as well. 
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <h5>5. Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc. </h5> <br/>
                        
                        Problems in the past I have had is losing skills from last classes and not using them for a while and having to do lots of time researching to get back into the swing of things. Lessons learned, don't forget! Retain Everything!
