                        <h5>1. What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</h5> <br/>
                        
                        I could make my HTML more accessible by making it easier to navigate, especially for the use of an app to be use by someone who is disabled or has a disability.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                        <h5>2. Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</h5> <br/>
                        
                        A common problem with a screen reader or mobile reader is that is reads everything on the screen and can be very confusing. Another issue is that the voices for these readers are not very pleasing to listen to. The voices are very robotic and they don't seem to read like a real person. After a while it becomes hard to follow and pay attention. Now these readers are useful in that they do allow people to get the benefit of having something read to them when they can't do it themselves.

                        <h5>3. Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h5> <br/>
                        
                        One feature that I take advantage of is the clicking of the fn button twice on the Mac Book Pro Mountain Lion allows you to speak to text. I use the everyday and is nice when someone else types so fast it hard to keep up, you can speak to text and stay up with the conversation. I have RA and a lot of times it is hard to use my fingers by typing for a long period of time. My fingers seem to have dyslexia so I love taking advantage of this function on the MacBook Pro.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Now on my android phone a feature that can be used is the font size feature to raise the font for people that have visual impairment. You can access this function in the settings in the accessibility. My wife seems to use this function a lot because she doesn't like to wear her classes so makes it easier for her to read.
                        
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <h5>4. Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h5> <br/> 
                        
                        Megaphone transforms your iPhone into an instant Microphone, PA system or Megaphone when you plug it into amplified speakers.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Transform your iPhone or iPad into a high-powered magnifier with a mind-boggling 1 - 100X magnification. Turning your device into a magnifier making it easier to read small lettering off example, medication bottles.
